We are import the caiable class which will be used to convert the tensors into some torch variables that will contain both the tensor and a gradient and then the torch variable containing the tensor in the gradients will be on element of the graph.\n",
    "- **`data`** is a folder that contains the classes `BaseTransform` and `VOC_CLASSES`: \n",
    "    - `BaseTransform` is a class that will do the required transformations so that the input images will be compatible with the neural network. (When we eed the neural network with the input images, they have to have a certain format and `BaseTransform` will be used to transform the images in this format so that they can be accepted into the neural network)\n",
    "    - `VOC_CLASSES` is a dictionary that will do the encoding of the classes, (for example: planes will be encoded as one) which is the idea of doing a mapping because we want to work with numbers and not text.\n",
    "- **`SSD`** is the library of the single shot multi-box action model and then `build_ssd` as that we import from the `SSD` library will be the constructor the architecture of single shot (not box detection) of the SSD neural network.\n",
