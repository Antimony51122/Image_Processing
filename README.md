**VERY IMPORTANT (the following information may save your ass (well, tons of hours of installation))**: if you are using ubuntu, be careful with anaconda because conda Interference might prevent the required packages to be installed into the system python (if your don't define your `PATH` to search for packages clearly in the environment, and each time you try to install a package, the computer will automatically find the installed package which might not in the required directory e.g. Anaconda). Disable the conda python and force the program to use the system default python instead is a secured choice. Then use `pip install` (or with a `sudo` in the front in some cases) to install all the packages required to run the project.
