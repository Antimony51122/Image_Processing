Set up udev rules for device access: 

sudo cp ../platform/linux/udev/90-kinect2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

then replug the Kinect.

def main():
    rospy.init_node('image_listener')
    # Define your image topic
    image_topic = "/cameras/left_hand_camera/image"
    # Set up your subscriber and define its callback
    rospy.Subscriber(image_topic, Image, image_callback)
    # Spin until ctrl + c
    rospy.spin()
```

change image_topic to the ros topic that has been subscribed

```
chmod +x ROS_imgProcessing2.py
```

using echo to check whether there is an output from the host master (baxter `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.110:11311/`) 

```
rostopic echo /camera/depth/image_raw
```
using echo to check whether the output from the remote computer is working
in this case:

```
rostopic echo image_topic_2
```

**Note**: Common Problems:
```
Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311/]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying.
```
to solve this, simply need to run 
```
roscore
```

```
cd /opt/ros/kinetic
source setup.bash
```

**Note**: can't subscribe to the ir and depth at the same instance, due that the depth detection comes from the ir
