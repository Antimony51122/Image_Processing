Overview
=============

The goal of this project is to program the FRANKA Emika robotic arm (nicknamed “Panda”) to prepare some breakfast and feed a person. The outcome of the project will be demonstrated by performing the whole scenario fully autonomously, including the perception of the person, the person’s mouth, etc. For inspiration, please watch `this video

Technical Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Forward and Inverse Kinematics:** To use the 7-dof kinematic model for Cartesian-to-Joint space mapping.
- **Redundancy Resolution:** To resolve the 7-dof arm configuration while following a 6-dof hand pose trajectory.
- **Perception:** Adding additional sensor for perceiving the person and his mouth. It could be an RGB-D camera (Kinect or Xtion) with skeleton tracking, or a face detecting high-speed webcam, for example.
- **Face detection and recognition:** To identify the person for feeding.
- **Mouth tracking:** To avoid problems when the person’s head is moving.
- **Motion Planning:** Using OMPL/MoveIt or other motion planning libraries to generate viable collision-free trajectories for executing the movements.
- **Motion Control:** To tune a Cartesian impedance controller or other for fast and smooth motion of the arm.
- **Hand control:** To control the grasping with the 2 fingers of the hand.
- **Bonus points:** For putting a baby bib on the person!
