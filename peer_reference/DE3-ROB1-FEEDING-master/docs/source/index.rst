About
^^^^^

The goal of this project is to program the FRANKA Emika robotic arm (nicknamed "Panda") to prepare some breakfast and feed a person. The outcome of the project will be demonstrated by performing the whole scenerio fully autonomously, including the perception of the person, the person's mouth, etc.
